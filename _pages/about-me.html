    - excerpt: |
        I am a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist based in Los Gatos and San Francisco, CA. I have a Holistic specialization, working with you from a whole person approach â€” taking the body, mind, and soul into consideration. However, I tailor my approach to what you are looking for, and what is right for you at this time. Regardless of what has brought you to therapy, your desired focus will lead our work together.

        I received my Masters of Arts in Counseling Psychology from John F. Kennedy University in 2015. Additionally, I have training in the Hakomi method, a body centered psychotherapy. I also trained in Brainspotting, in Sensorimotor Psychotherapy for Trauma and the Developmental Model of Couples Therapy.

        Prior to private practice, I have worked as an intern at Hospice of Santa Cruz County and then at Family Services of the Central Coast. At Hospice, I did grief work with individuals, and I use this experience as a basis to work with losses of all kinds. At Family Services I have been working with individuals, couples, families and children. My multifaceted approach to treatment is based on this wide variety of trainings and experience. Born and raised in Europe, my unique personal history also adds to my understandings and capacities as a therapist and counselor.
