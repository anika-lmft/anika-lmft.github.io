I see individuals and couples for short or long term work. I work with a variety of techniques: 
* talk therapy
* body-centered psychotherapy
* expressive arts interventions
* trans-personal therapy approaches
* ERP (Exposure and Response Prevention) for OCD

Your preferences and needs will lead our work together.
