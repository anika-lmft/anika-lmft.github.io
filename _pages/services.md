I see individuals and couples for short or long term work. I work with a variety of techniques: 
* talk therapy
* body-centered psychotherapy
* expressive arts interventions
* trans-personal therapy approaches

Your preferences and needs will lead our work together.

Some areas of focus are:

- Life transitions
- Relationship issues
- Parenting
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Finding meaning in life
- Self-criticism and/or developing self-compassion
- Spiritual questions
- Grief and loss
- Couples work
