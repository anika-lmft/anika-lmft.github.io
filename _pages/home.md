## If you are looking for individual therapy:

Having an unbiased person to talk to during difficult times can create the space for meaningful changes. Maybe you are experiencing depression and sadness and don't know how to get through the day. Maybe it's anxiety or excessive worry that make ordinary activities overwhelming. Sometimes intimate relationships can cause distress and discomfort. And then there's grief and loss through bereavement that begs for its own deep process, requiring us to face its shape-shifting face of emotions.

These experiences can be isolating, making it seem like no one would understand. Reaching out for help is a great first step. Whether you need support with painful feelings, difficult relationships, or personal growth, I am honored to help.

I will work through any discomfort with you in a gentle yet profound way to enhance your everyday experience, seeking to bring more meaning to your life. Together we can explore your emotional and behavioral patterns, and work together to help you find more ease. My goal is to help you integrate, or make sense of, your past, your thoughts, and your feelingsâ€”coming to a place of greater compassion for yourself and satisfaction for your life.

## If you are looking for couples therapy: 

My approach to couples work is deeply compassionate and comes from the belief that when given the right support, change is possible. I deeply respect the courage it takes to enter couples therapy. It often occurs at a time when a couple feels stuck or when parts of the relationship feel painful. I offer a way of working with the psychological development of the couple that can support clearer communication with each other, and a greater ability to navigate conflict. I also work with the understanding that partners in a couple are influenced by their own attachment needs. I seek to bring awareness to these underlying dynamics, so that they can be expressed to each other more effectively. Additionally, I am well versed in trauma informed modalities and I consider influences of past trauma and how it affects the ability to relate and feel safe in current relationships.

If you would like to talk with me to see if working together would be a good fit, please call for a complimentary 15 minute phone consultation. I can answer any questions you may have, or we can simply get to know each other.
